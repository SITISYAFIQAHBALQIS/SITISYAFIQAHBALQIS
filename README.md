## Hello, 👋.
This is merely a test for my first GitHub account using my Delima, alas, school account.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning SK, "Sains Komputer", alas, Science Computer. Current ambition is being able to properly understanding the basic concept of computer coding, scripting, etc.
- For example, learning how to use Java or Phyton.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a multifandom. My favourites are Creepypasta AND Slendermansion AU, as well as SCP ^ ^
